COVID-19 Multi-Country Data Analysis

This project looks at COVID-19 data from different countries using PySpark for data processing and MongoDB for storage. It's main parts are:
	Data preprocessing (dates, integers, etc.)
	Key metrics like total cases, new daily cases, and active cases
	Clean and clear visualizations with Matplotlib and Pandas
	Data export to MongoDB for further use

Load your CSV, run the notebook, and see the results!
